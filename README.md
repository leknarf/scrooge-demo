A DocPad Skeleton useful for Creating Websites. Includes themes for HTML5 Boiler Plate, Initializr, and Twitter Bootstrap.

This skeleton is made for the just released DocPad v5.2. There are a few things still being worked on such as proper styling for themes, but it is still a fantastic showcase of what to look forward to around the corner :-)
